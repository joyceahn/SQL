# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then, I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#The table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
    id               INTEGER        PRIMARY KEY,
    artist_name      VARCHAR        NOT NULL,
    track_name       VARCHAR        NOT NULL,
    track_id         VARCHAR        NOT NULL,
    popularity       INTEGER        NOT NULL,
    danceability     DECIMAL (4, 3) NOT NULL,
    energy           DECIMAL (4, 3) NOT NULL,
    song_key         INTEGER        NOT NULL,
    loudness         DECIMAL (5, 3) NOT NULL,
    song_mode        INTEGER        NOT NULL,
    speechiness      DECIMAL (5, 4) NOT NULL,
    acousticness     DECIMAL (6, 5) NOT NULL,
    instrumentalness DECIMAL (8, 7) NOT NULL,
    liveness         DECIMAL (5, 4) NOT NULL,
    valence          DECIMAL (4, 3) NOT NULL,
    tempo            DECIMAL (6, 3) NOT NULL,
    duration_ms      INTEGER        NOT NULL,
    time_signature   INTEGER        NOT NULL
);

#Then, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--1. What is the average danceability by artist and track? 

SELECT artist_name,
       track_name,
       AVG(danceability) 
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 GROUP BY 1,
          2
 ORDER BY 3 DESC;
 
-- 2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name,
       popularity
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 2 DESC
 LIMIT 10;
 
-- 3. What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name,
       track_name,
       duration_ms
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 WHERE duration_ms IN (
           SELECT MAX(duration_ms) 
             FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
       );
       
-- 4. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT track_name,
       AVG(danceability) 
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY Spotifydata.popularity DESC
 LIMIT 10;
 
--5. Which artist released the least energetic song?

SELECT artist_name,
       track_name,
       energy
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 WHERE energy IN (
           SELECT MIN(energy) 
             FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
       );
   
--6. Which songs make up the Top 10 Loudest?

SELECT track_name,
       artist_name,
       loudness
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 GROUP BY 1,
          2
 ORDER BY 3 DESC
 LIMIT 10;

--7. What is the average liveness for the Top 10 Loudest tracks?

SELECT track_name,
       AVG(liveness) 
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY Spotifydata.loudness DESC
 LIMIT 10;
