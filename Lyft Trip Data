--In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Lyft data to answer questions about the data.

--1. Create a trip log with the trips and its users using a LEFT JOIN.

SELECT *
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;

--2. Create a link between the trips and the cars used during those trips using an INNER JOIN.

SELECT *
FROM trips
JOIN cars
  ON trips.car_id = cars.id;

--3. Combine riders data and new riders data. 

SELECT * 
FROM riders
UNION 
SELECT * FROM 
riders2;

--4. What is the average cost for a trip?

SELECT ROUND(AVG(cost), 2) as avg_cost
FROM trips;

--5. Find all riders who've used Lyft less than 500 times. 

SELECT first, last, total_trips
FROM riders
WHERE total_trips < 500
UNION 
SELECT first, last, total_trips
FROM riders2
WHERE total_trips < 500
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

--6. Calculate the number of active cars. 

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM cars
WHERE status = 'active';

--7. Find the two cars with the highest trips_completed. 

SELECT *
FROM cars
ORDER BY trips_completed DESC
LIMIT 2;
