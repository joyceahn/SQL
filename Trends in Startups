SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) as avg_valuation
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--6. Return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it. Filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them.

GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
